Being a web developer means that you need to always stay in touch with the new **technologies** and **tools** that are coming up on the market.

Recently, I've found an interest in learning some **React Frameworks**

- Gatsby
- NextJs

After following both **tutorials**, I think I will stick with **NextJs** as I found it less abstract and more enjoyable to use.
